# assembly_linkedLists_Pointers_Arrays_Sorting
  Line-by-line analysis of assembly code of C code. C code creates an array with insertion of integers, linked list as well s pointers and sorting these data types. The assembly code is interpreted from this C code in order to give thorough explanation of each line of assembly and its function in the program to see "under-the-hood" how higher level languages go down into smaller level languages and similarities in arithmetics as well as differences. 
  This project allowed me to gain some knowledge in C as well as a lot more of a understanding of assembly code.
